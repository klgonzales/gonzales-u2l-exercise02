# What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
1. Working on HTML and CSS projects gave me valuable hands-on experience. It allowed me to put my theoretical knowledge into practice, which deepened my understanding of concepts and improved my skills.
2. Creating the UI for my project enhanced my UI design skills. I enjoyed experimenting with layouts, colors, fonts, and other design elements to create visually appealing interfaces.
