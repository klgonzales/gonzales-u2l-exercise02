# Steps on how to create GitHub page
Step 1: Navigate to your website's repository
Once you're logged in, locate the repository in the left sidebar and choose the one you wish to publish.

Step 2: Access the settings
Within your repository, navigate to the Settings option, which will direct you to the repository's settings page.

Step 3: Access GitHub Pages
While in the repository's settings, scroll down until you find the Pages link on the left sidebar. Click on it to access GitHub Pages.

Step 4: Specify the branch
Under the source section, click on the dropdown menu and select the master branch, then save your selection. Note that depending on how it's named, it may be labeled as master or main.

Step 5: Completion
You're all set! Your website will now be published, and the process typically takes just a minute or so to complete. Refresh the page, and you'll find a link to your newly published website.

# What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
1. Working on HTML and CSS projects gave me valuable hands-on experience. It allowed me to put my theoretical knowledge into practice, which deepened my understanding of concepts and improved my skills.
2. Creating the UI for my project enhanced my UI design skills. I enjoyed experimenting with layouts, colors, fonts, and other design elements to create visually appealing interfaces. It helped me understand what works well together and what doesn't in terms of design. I still have a long way to go but this is so fun to make.
3. During the project, I encountered various challenges, such as aligning elements, styling components, and achieving responsiveness. Addressing these challenges honed my problem-solving skills and encouraged me to explore different solutions.
