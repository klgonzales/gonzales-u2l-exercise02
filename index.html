                        <p>I am Katrina L. Gonzales, a passionate Software Developer specializing in Front-end and Database technologies. Throughout my journey, 
                            I have embraced challenges and opportunities that have shaped me both personally and professionally. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer
                            Science at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB), with an expected graduation year of 2025. <br>
    
                            <br> My technical expertise spans across Front-end technologies like React and JavaScript, Mobile Development with Dart and Flutter, as well as Database and <br>
                            Back-end systems including Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am proficient in utilizing developer tools such as Git and npm, and possess strong soft skills including <br>
                            Communication, Collaboration, and Analytical Thinking. <br>
    
                            <br> Prior to focusing on software development, I established myself as a Freelance Digital Artist through my personal brand "Pusanggalart." 
                            This venture allowed me to showcase my creativity and build a strong online presence, successfully selling various digital artworks and establishing a loyal following. <br>
    
                            <br> I also gained valuable experience as a Customer Service Representative at Concentrix, where I provided dedicated support in managing a healthcare insurance account, 
                            demonstrating empathy and proficiency in resolving customer inquiries.<br>
    
                            <br> Within the Alliance of Computer Science Students - UPLB (ACSS - UPLB), I serve as a Developer, contributing to various initiatives aimed at engaging the public on relevant
                            computer science topics and events through social media content creation. Additionally, I held roles such as Marketing Representative for ACSS Week, where I negotiated sponsorships,

                            <br> My journey as a Software Developer has been characterized by a blend of technical expertise, creative expression, and leadership roles. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, 
                            leveraging my skills to contribute meaningfully to the field of technology and beyond.<br>
